    <h3>Ids and Classes</h3>

    <!-- a Unique id is to be given to all elements as Id can not be repeated, but a class can be given to multiple elements of the same kind and multiple elementscan also be inserted inside a single class -->
    <!-- what a class essentially does is it gives certain attributes to the elements inside of the class whereas an id allows  us to call the elements inside of it, essentially by giving it a unique name -->
    <!-- the properties of a class can be defined by us by using CSS -->
    <div id="Mainbox" class="redBg">
        this is the Mainbox
    </div>
    <span class="redBg blackBorder"></span>

    <!-- to call an Id or a class by using emmet -->
    <!-- . is for class and # is for id -->
    <!-- span.RedbG.blackborder -->
    <span class="RedbG blackborder"></span>
    
    <!-- #MainStream.redBg -->
    <div id="MainStream" class="redBg"></div>
    <!-- span#mainstream.Blackborder -->
    <span id="mainstream" class="Blackborder"></span>

<!-- div.redbg.blackborder*4 -->
