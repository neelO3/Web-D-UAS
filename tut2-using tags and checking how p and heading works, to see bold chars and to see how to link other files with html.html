    <body>
    the body of the file that we have written goes here

     <h1>this is the main heading of the file</h1> <!--there must only be one main heading of the file that we are creating  -->
    <h2>this could be the sub-heading</h2>

    <h3>notice how the size of the heading files keep decreasing</h3>
     
    <h4>the files go on till h6 and the size keeps decreasing</h4> 

    <p>p is for the paragraph and here goes the text that we are using, everything that is written here goes in one single paragraph</p>

    <p>for changing the paragraph, we can start again by creating p</p>
        <!-- can make multiple paragraph by writing p*4(creates 4 paragraph lines) -->

    <p>for creating a bold char,  use <strong> this is bold</strong> and for italicizing the letters <em>this will be emphasized</em></p>

    to break a line we use the <br> br tag
    <hr> this is used for creating a horizontal line 
<!-- lorem 23 fro 23 dummy words -->
