    <title>Using HTML entities</title>

    <p>In HTML we cant use multiple                spaces at the same time as the language will cut all of those spaces and will turn that into a single space, hence we use HTML entities</p>
    <p>to use multiple spaces at the same time, use &nbsp;  &NonBreakingSpace; for creating two spaces </p>
<!-- similarly other entitites can also be used -->
    <p>This is another Paragraph &lt;p&gt; </p>
    <!-- similar to how\ is used in python as an escape character -->
    <!-- similarly other entities can also be used in> html -->
    <p>This is for the pound symbol &pound; </p>
    <p>This is for the copyright symbol &copy; </p>
    <p>This is for fraction 1/5 &frac15; </p>
    <!-- many other entities can be searched online -->
    <!-- check how to use semantic elements, lec12 of code with harry -->
